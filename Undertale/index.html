                <h1 id="overall-rating-2-10">Overall Rating <strong>2 /10</strong></h1>
<p>I've played it twice, I first played it when I was 13, and yesterday, now I am an adult, I played again.<br>
But this time, I decide to give it only 2 stars.</p>
<h1 id="music-9-10">Music <strong>9 /10</strong></h1>
<p>As we all know I am a music lover and learner, and, of course, a music researcher! So no matter what the works are, one of the things I VALUE most must be MUSIC!</p>
<p>The music style is electricity and 8-bit, I think it's deeply retro, especially 8-bit. It always reminds me of those classicial games such as Super Mario, Maple Story, etc.</p>
<p>In Undertale, obviously the soundtrack is nice! I like Toby Fox so much, because he is so brilliant that not only he can code, but also he can make music.<br>
The melody of it seem that so similair, It seems that Fox is a little lazy, lol.But I don't really think so. Some similair melodies, they're very unified, make the overall theme so clear. That's so clever.<br>
And, it is a pixel game. Pixel style always remind people of a word, RETRO. So the repetitive melodies create this perfectly.</p>
<p>Also, do you know MEMZ? It's a trojan horse created for Microsoft computers.<br>
If your computer infected with this virus, a pixel Nyan Cat will appear in your screen, with brainwashing 8-bit music.<br>
So 8-bit style can deeply let people to remember it.</p>
<p>So, the music style fascinates me deeply, Although it's easy to get tired of it if you hear it too much. This is the biggest disadvantage of this sort of music.</p>
<h1 id="art-style-5-10">Art Style <strong>5 /10</strong></h1>
<p>Yeah it's a pixel game, it looks so retro.<br>
And because the story is about human-beings and monsters, with a very ancient historical background, so I think using pixel style is a very very brilliant choice!!! This can well strengthen the background of this story.<br>
Morever, I can feel a sense of fantasy, lonely, and a fairy tale.<br>
That's so great.</p>
<p>But I only give it 5 stars instead of full stars.The reason is simple, I also think some scenes are a little monotonous, it's easy to get tired of it too. Maybe it's the biggest disadvantage of pixel style.<br>
And, I think it can also have different scenes. Give an example, in Snowdin Town, I think it can have more scenes such as riverside (although it really has), more differnet sorts of houses (because it is called Snowdin Town).<br>
But unfortunately, there are only large forests in Snowdin Town.</p>
<p>If a game's scenes always a bit similar, players are absolutely bored of it soon.</p>
<h1 id="game-mechanic-1-10">Game Mechanic <strong>1 /10</strong></h1>
<p>I admit that the game mechanic is very novel and innovative.<br>
But it still has a fatal problem.<br>
Because its particularity, I'll talk about this in detail below, with the script.<br>
Now let's talk alone about it.</p>
<h2 id="auto-archive">Auto archive</h2>
<p><img src="https://blog.altartist.art/post-images/1758339186328.png" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Let's check this image above. It's the scene when Frisk left the ruins and came to Snowdin Town. And when I played there, my computer got wrong and the game crashed by itself, so obviously I didn't save the archive.<br>
Maybe it's because I've played too much The Witcher 3 (The games are like it all have auto archieve) , I would think that it would automatically save the game if I arrived at a new location.<br>
But unfortunately, it doesn't have this function.<br>
And don't forget it is a RPG, this function is very important.</p>
<h2 id="skipping-dialogue">Skipping Dialogue</h2>
<p>As a RPG, it absolutely has many dialogues.<br>
But you don't have to read every word the NPC says.<br>
And... Logically speaking, a conversation should be displayed immediately after pressing the Enter key.<br>
But this game seems not to do it.</p>
<h2 id="monster-refresh">Monster Refresh</h2>
<p>Oh my god I must complain about this.<br>
Emmm... why there were always monsters pestered me as I walked on the map? I think the refresh frequency is too high.</p>
<h2 id="teleport-point">Teleport point</h2>
<p>As we all know there are some different scenes in Undertale, but to my surprised it doesn't have teleport points...<br>
Having teleport points is very important for RPG. Because if you feel a little boring about the game such as you can't clear the level, you must want to come back to the places you've visited before,or you forgot to take some important items in the previous map.<br>
If the game has teleport points, you can quickly come back instead of walking to here...</p>
<p>Now let me talk about an important issue.<br>
You'll meet a spider called Muffet, and you must &quot;fight&quot; with her.<br>
But it's difficult to defeat her if you dont have some special snacks for her.<br>
And when I first played there, well I'm not good at playing games so it spent me a very long time to clear the level. The biggest reason was I didn't know those special snacks should be given to her... Because I need to restore my HP, I ate it in advance...<br>
You may say you can directly  kill her, or risist her attack. But I wanna say, is it very meaningful? If the auther wants to reflect the special gameplay of the game, I think this is very far-fetched.</p>
<h1 id="story-1-10">Story <strong>1 /10</strong></h1>
<p>To be honest, this game is highly recommended by my friend. She told me that its story is very very nice. Not only her, medias, people on the Internet, even IGN all think so.<br>
But I don't care, I only hear my heart. I will not change my subjective opinion based on the opinions of others or even so-called professional rating media as IGN, IMDb.</p>
<p>If I describe this story, it would be extremely childish, pretentious, and overly preachy!</p>
<h2 id="first">First</h2>
<p>The characterization is almost very weak.<br>
That means I can't feel any souls of the characters. It seems that signs with words hanging on their faces, and when I met a new character, I always felt that it didn't a character in front of me, it should be the auther... It seems that all the characters are actually just the author himself.</p>
<p>And lots of people all think the story is so nice just because it has many endings?<br>
In my opinion, I only think it only has 3 endings. First, killed all characters. Second, killed nobody. Third, killed a little.<br>
The other endings are just extra insignificant things.</p>
<p>And... do you really think these should be called as A deep and philosophical story?<br>
Too CHILDISH!!!!!!<br>
Because the world is not black and white, and everyone should be complicated. We need to know someone's motivation for doing a thing.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, these characters have no soul, because there is basically no characterization, which is very interesting.<br>
So, if player determind to kill anyone he/she met, what reason do the monsters to condemn he/she?<br>
This is like a self-directed performance. But I am a player, so why should I act with you?</p>
<h2 id="second">Second</h2>
<p>Yeah it's not only a RPG but also a MetaGame!<br>
Don't you think it's contradictory?<br>
Logically speaking, RPG requires players to fully immerse themselves in the role, let alone a fairy tale-like story in such a fantasy world.<br>
But what's the MetaGame?!<br>
I don't wanna explain it here, please go to check Wikipedia.</p>
<h2 id="third">Third</h2>
<p>I really don't think monsters in it have soul. At least the auther let them DON'T HAVE SOUL.<br>
The reason is simple. Lots of people including the auther all think that monsters are also independent individuals and they also desire peace with humans, so we can definitely communicate with them and we can influence them with love.<br>
But I really don't think so. It's so unreasonable. It's so childish!</p>
<p>First of all, seeking common ground while reserving differences is difficult to achieve in reality, so why can every monster be persuaded? Why do they always have the same ideas?<br>
And why can the protagonist influence them?</p>
<p>If I have to give a reason, I can only say that the author has created monsters that are completely lacking in subject consciousness and their own standpoints, while he himself stands high above the human perspective, like a savior saving them.<br>
But this in itself is unequal.</p>
<p>Morever, this game is full of too many long-winded sermons, but as mentioned before, the characterization of the monsters is almost non-existent, and the whole thing is very confusing. As an RPG, it is completely impossible to get into the role.</p>
<p>So I don't know why lots of people all think it is a nice, perfect story.<br>
From an RPG perspective, it doesn't qualify.<br>
From a Meta perspective, it doesn't qualify too.</p>
