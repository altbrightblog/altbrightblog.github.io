                <h1 id="overall-rating-4-10">Overall Rating <strong>4 /10</strong></h1>
<p>Because it's a movie about Music, so I had a great interest in it.<br>
But when I really watched it, oh my god, my feeling is like a roller coaster.<br>
The rating, at first was 8, then became 6... Finally, I rate it <strong>3</strong>.</p>
<p>In general, the movie is good,but absolutely not can be called <strong>PERFECT</strong>.Many disadvantages in it.<br>
There is no doubt that the director's shooting style, camera movement, scenery, colors, etc. are all very good. But it still has many disadvantages.</p>
<h1 id="casting-3-10">Casting <strong>3 /10</strong></h1>
<p>First, there is a very huge problem with the casting of the movie. I'm not saying Tim Roth's acting is bad, but he's really not suited to this role. I think 1900 should be a shy, with very few words,when you first see him, you will immediately feel that he is a person who has been on the ship since he was born, a person who is isolated from the world, dares not speak, and keeps a distance from the world.<br>
But Tim's look can't make me feel like that. I think he is more like a shrewd businessman. Anyway, definitely not a musician with a special aura who is isolated from the world.<br>
So when I watched it,I always feel out of place.</p>
<p>The other actors are well cast.But 1900 is the main character of this movie,the MAIN character's casting is not suitable, so I only give its casting 3 stars.</p>
<h1 id="fonts-1-10">Fonts <strong>1 /10</strong></h1>
<p>I MUST say about this topic, because I am a designer.<br>
As we all know, at the beginning of a movie, there are always the main characters' actor/actresses' names, and the movie's name.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the plot of this movie is too far-fetched, it describes the story of a legendary &quot;musician&quot; who has passed away, the way of recollection, and perhaps the nostalgia for the past.<br>
But the font of the beginning of the movie actually uses <strong>cursive</strong>!!!<br>
Is this a light and romantic movie?<br>
I'm curious about it,why the director used such fonts ...<br>
This is not SERIOUS at all!</p>
<p>In my opinion, movies'topics like this, must use atmospheric and serious fonts, like Times New Roman.<br>
Or, if you use wrong fonts, your works will immediately become disjointed and inconsistent, and with a strong sense of separation.</p>
<h1 id="soundtrack-5-10">Soundtrack <strong>5 /10</strong></h1>
<p>Have to say, the music is so nice! Especially its melody.<br>
But, because it is a movie about MUSIC, MUSICIAN, so I think the requirements for music should be higher, isn't that too much?<br>
Obviously, the soul of the movie is PIANO, but the soundtrack is too monotonous, It emphasizes the melody of the right hand too much and dilutes the melody of the left hand. So I quickly developed visual fatigue with the soundtrack.<br>
Because the structure of the music is too monotonous and lacks layering. Even piano music shouldn't be like this.</p>
<p>And... If you have interest in composing or music production, you must use FL Studio or Logic Pro. In softwares like these, a song is made up of many tracks. If you don't want your music to be monotonous, then there must be many tracks.</p>
<h1 id="story-2-10">Story <strong>2 /10</strong></h1>
<p>Without a doubt, I think Max is a very good person. He can always trust 1900 and be his only friend. I think this is very precious.<br>
And obviously 1900 is more talented than him, at least that's what the story wants to say, but Max doesn't envy him for this, which is very rare.<br>
Take myself as an example, because I am so brilliant, my friends of many years have parted ways with me, and the old people who have accomplished nothing will also be jealous of me. This is how I spent my adolescence.<br>
So I give one more star only for Max.</p>
<p>But the story is just a f**king laughing, childish, and overly didactic story.That's all.</p>
<h2 id="first">First</h2>
<p>As a music/piano learner and researcher, I am very clearly about it. No matter how talented you are, you can't learn to play the piano just by listening to music. If playing the piano is so easy, why aren't there so many musicians in the world?<br>
So just based on this point, it can be seen that the director did not understand music at all, and did not seem to want to study it specifically for making a movie about music.<br>
In a sense, such behavior is a disgrace to music and pianists.</p>
<p>Also, the film seems to be very interested in showing 1900's ability to improvise. That's so good. Yeah that's right! It would be cool if a person could improvise and express his or her mood freely with an instrument.<br>
But that's very very difficult.<br>
Improvisation relies heavily on chords and accumulation. Basic chords must be learned through books and etudes, as well as melodies.<br>
Improvisation requires a very high level of comprehensive ability, and I absolutely do not believe that someone who only stays on a boat and listens to music can improvise music for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>Moreover, the director seems to have absolutely no understanding of the piano. Playing fast does not equal playing well. If that is the case, then what is the meaning of Chopin's existence?</p>
<h2 id="second">Second</h2>
<p>We all know that great artists such as Yves Saint Laurent and Van Gogh(and me)must have had a life as colorful and legendary as fireworks.<br>
Because of his experience that is completely different from that of the rest of the world and his strong perception, he was able to write a shocking epic. Even if he is gifted, he must be subject to learning and guidance.</p>
<p>But the movie seems to have completely forgotten this point, and glossed over 1900's early life in a passing moment, as if he was inexplicably struck by talent and then began to compose impromptu music.<br>
This completely dilutes the legendary color, but instead strengthens the feeling that 1900 is a fictional character in the movie.</p>
<p>So... I can say, 1900 is absolutely a fictional character created by Max.</p>
<p>Just based on the above two points, this story has nothing to do with being a GOOD story.</p>
<h2 id="third">Third</h2>
<p>At the end of the movie, 1900 and the old ship were blown up in the sea. It really is the end of an era!<br>
Most people think that 1900 is very pure and his death is very legendary.<br>
But I dont think so.<br>
I think he got killed in the bombing purely because he was a coward, not because he was a musician who did not conform to the world.</p>
<p>First of all, have you ever thought about this question: Do you think 1900 really exists? Is he really a human being?<br>
I think he didn't exist, and, absolutely not a human being.<br>
Because he is not social.</p>
<p>So I am more inclined to believe that 1900 does not exist in essence, which explains why only Max found him in the dilapidated old ship in the end.</p>
<p>To be honest, what attracted me most in the beginning of this movie was the ethereal character of 1900. I always thought that he was unwilling to leave the ship even if he was blown up because he found the world to be secular and totally incompatible with his pure and innocent musical world.<br>
However, the more I looked at it, I realized that this was not the case at all!</p>
<p>At the end of the movie, 1900 gave a long, very preachy speech, much like those damn teachers in school.<br>
He said, <em>In all that sprawlling city, there was everything except an end... They are(keys) not infinite, you are infinite... Did you see the streets? Just the streets, there were thousands of them...</em></p>
<p>Perhaps the director felt that this passage was full of philosophical meaning, which directly sublimated the theme of the film.<br>
But I think this paragraph directly destroyed 1900's character and made the theme of the whole story ridiculous and childish!!!</p>
<p>I just think he is cowardly and afraid of change. To be honest, I look down on such people. They have no courage, they will only surrender. They are just cowards and have nothing to do with transcending the mundane!<br>
1900's rejection of land was based on the fact that he never thought he would get it.</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>So, I think this is a pseudo-musical movie, and it is very superficial and very insincere.</p>
